Project : Bike Share Data

Date submitted: 02/06/2023
I have used the data of three cities for the data analysis of BikeShare. This data was available fron Udacity Python course resources.

I also referred to https://stackoverflow.com/ for some pandas functions

I have used pandas, lists, while loop, conditional statements, functions and time modules to implement this analysis.

Here are the questions that I have been able to answer through my code:

Statistics displayed:
Most popular month
Most popular day of the week
Most popular hour of the day
Most popular station to start
most popular station to end
Most popular trip from start to end stations
Total Travel Time (Hrs)
Average Travel time (Hrs)
Count of users by type
Counts of users by gender
Earliest birth year
Most recent birth year
Most common year of birth

The statistics above are displayed after asking the user to enter the required city, Month and day details. I used the below questionnaire to get the inputs:

Select a city to analyze? (Chicago/New York city/Washington)
Select a month to analyze? (january/february/march/april/may/june/all)
Select a day of week to analyze? (sunday/monday/tuesday/wednesday/thursday/friday/saturday/all)
